Summary of tcR circle file (and finding dominant genes/pairings)

1. Dominant genes (individual AV, AJ, BV, BJ)
Looked at bar charts from tcR.R output

2. Dominant AVAJ and BVBJ pairings
Parsed MiXCR produces list of dataframes. Unlist and convert to dataframe format.
Divided into patient and tabulated V.gene v J.gene - generated individual chord diagrams for each patient to look at pairings
Chord diagram (loop) for all CD4 and CD8

3. Dominant AB pairings
Used MiXCR list of dataframes.
Noted down row numbers in metadata for each patient - this dictates order of dataframes in list.
Used loop to pull out dataframes specific for each patient - only V.gene and J.gene columns, to create a new dataframe for each patient.
Each row also had cell number - ideally, each cell would have 2 rows in each column, one for B and one for A
Filtered to only select cells that had 2 rows (discarding those that had 1 A or B, or multiple A/B - dual receptor T cells?)
Used group_by and summarise_each to combine AVBV and AJBJ into one cell, so now each cell has 1 row across 2 columns
Tabulate V.gene v J.gene, can either look at table to see dominant pair or do chord diagram
Chord diagram (loop) only from CD4 as unclear looking at table which ones dominant pair(s)
